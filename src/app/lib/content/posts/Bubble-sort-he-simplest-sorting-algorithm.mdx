# Bubble Sort: The Simplest Sorting Algorithm

<AnimatedParagraph>
  Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, known for its ease of
  implementation and visualization. Imagine a dramatic scenario where a plane is
  crashing, and the stewardess announces that the only way to save everyone is
  by writing a sorting algorithm. Even under such pressure, you could quickly
  write bubble sort — it’s that simple!

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Key Characteristics</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Bubble sort is incredibly straightforward,
    often described as just three lines of code.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Visualization:</strong> Easy to visualize and understand, making it
    a great educational tool.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>In-place Sorting:</strong> Sorts the array in place, requiring no
    extra space beyond the input array.
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Understanding the Algorithm</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
  comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the
  wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating
  that the list is sorted.

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Time Complexity</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  Despite its simplicity, bubble sort is not the most efficient algorithm. Its
  average and worst-case time complexity is O(n²), where n is the number of
  items being sorted. This quadratic time complexity makes it impractical for
  large datasets, but it’s still useful for educational purposes and small
  arrays.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>How Bubble Sort Works</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Initial Pass:</strong> Start at the beginning of the array. Compare
    the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second,
    swap them. Move to the next pair and repeat until the end.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Largest Element Sorted:</strong> After the first pass, the largest
    element “bubbles up” to its correct position at the end of the array.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Subsequent Passes:</strong> Repeat for remaining elements, ignoring
    the last sorted element. Each pass positions the next largest element
    correctly.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Completion:</strong> Continue until no more swaps are needed. The
    array is now sorted.
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Example Implementation</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedCode>
  {`function bubbleSort(arr: number[]): void {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        const tmp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}`}
</AnimatedCode>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Explanation of the Code</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Outer Loop:</strong> Ensures enough passes to sort the entire array.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Inner Loop:</strong> Performs comparisons and swaps on the unsorted
    portion of the array.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Comparison and Swap:</strong> If the current element is greater than
    the next, swap them.
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    <strong>Optimizing the Range:</strong> The <code>- i</code> adjustment
    prevents already sorted elements from being compared again.
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Conclusion</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  Bubble sort is a fundamental algorithm that illustrates the basic principles
  of sorting. While not suitable for large datasets due to its O(n²) complexity,
  its simplicity and ease of understanding make it a valuable educational tool.
  Whether you’re a beginner learning sorting algorithms or need a quick, simple
  sort for a small dataset, bubble sort is an essential part of any programmer’s
  toolkit.
