# Migrating a Live Portfolio from React to Next.js

<AnimatedParagraph>
  When you decide to overhaul your own website, it feels different from working
  on a client project. There’s no project manager setting deadlines, but there’s
  also no safety net if things go wrong. Every bug, every deployment
  misstep—it's all yours.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  I built my portfolio using **Vite and React** because they’re lightweight,
  fast, and developer-friendly. But as I started adding more projects, images,
  and interactive features, I hit the limits of static rendering. SEO needed a
  boost, performance needed a push, and I wanted a stack that could grow with
  me—not hold me back.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  Enter **Next.js 15**. The framework promised server-side rendering, image
  optimization, and a cleaner developer experience. The challenge? Moving a live
  site over **without a single pixel out of place** and **without any
  downtime.**
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>The Challenge</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  This wasn’t just about swapping frameworks—it was a careful rebuild under the
  hood. The portfolio had to stay online, fully functional, and visually
  identical from start to finish.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Migrated a live portfolio site from **Vite/React** to **Next.js 15**
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>Zero downtime during the entire process</AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Maintained exact visual appearance and functionality
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  The goal was to make the migration invisible to visitors. They’d never know
  the site changed frameworks—only that it loaded faster.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Technical Achievements</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  The migration required restructuring the app to match Next.js conventions
  while keeping every feature intact. This included translating components,
  adjusting routing, and updating image handling.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Successfully migrated **15+ components and utilities**
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Preserved all existing features (modals, carousels, contact forms)
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Updated image handling from Vite's static imports to **Next.js Image
    optimization**
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Migrated routing from React Router to **Next.js App Router**
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  This wasn’t a copy-paste job—it was about aligning React components with
  Next.js’ opinionated, optimized architecture.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Migration Strategy</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  A successful migration starts with a plan. I avoided the “big bang” rewrite by
  migrating incrementally and validating each step.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Used **feature branch approach** to avoid disrupting main deployment
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Implemented **Next.js migration bridge** for incremental migration
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Preserved all assets and moved them to **public folder structure**
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Updated build configuration for **Vercel deployment**
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  This approach provided safety nets. If something broke, it happened in
  development or staging—not on production.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Key Benefits Realized</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  Once deployed, the improvements were immediate. Pages loaded faster, SEO
  scores improved, and development felt smoother.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Better performance with Next.js optimizations
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Improved SEO through **server-side rendering**
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Enhanced developer experience with TypeScript and modern tooling
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Future scalability for adding new features
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  This migration wasn’t just a one-time upgrade—it laid the groundwork for rapid
  iteration in the future.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Lessons Learned</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  No migration is completely smooth. Here are the key insights I took away from
  the process:
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Framework detection on deployment platforms needs manual configuration
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Asset migration requires careful path updates
  </AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>
    Incremental migration is safer than big-bang rewrites
  </AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

<AnimatedParagraph>
  These lessons will save me hours on the next major upgrade—and hopefully help
  anyone attempting a similar move.
</AnimatedParagraph>

<AnimatedHeading level={2}>Tools & Technologies</AnimatedHeading>

<AnimatedList>
  <AnimatedListItem>Next.js 15 with App Router</AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>TypeScript for type safety</AnimatedListItem>
  <AnimatedListItem>Vercel for deployment</AnimatedListItem>
</AnimatedList>

  This migration demonstrates how to modernize a production React app without
  losing functionality or user experience!
