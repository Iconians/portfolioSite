# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site â€” a hub for my freelance work, client reviews, and technical articles. I first built this site with React and recently upgraded to **Next.js** to improve performance, SEO, and scalability.  

This project isn't just a portfolio â€” it's also where I practice new technologies, experiment with patterns, and refine my development workflow.
