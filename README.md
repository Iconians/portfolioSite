# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site — a hub for my freelance work, client reviews, and technical articles.  
This site began as a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript build, evolved into a React + TypeScript app, and is now rebuilt with Next.js 15 for modern performance, SEO, and scalability.

It’s not just a showcase — it’s my testing ground for design systems, motion-based UI, and full-stack experiments.

## For Recruiters

### What You'll Find

- **Freelance projects** – real-world work solving client needs since 2022  
- **Client reviews** – feedback pulled directly from my Upwork profile  
- **Technical articles** – based on both client experience and deep research/practice projects  
- **Motion-rich design** – nearly every component is animated, from headings and sections to lists, code blocks, and blog cards  

### Why Next.js?

- Fast performance and improved SEO with server-side rendering  
- Scalable routing for quickly adding new projects, articles, and sections  
- Polished user experience with consistent animations across the site  
- Modern toolchain built to grow as my work expands
