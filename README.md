# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site â€” a hub for my freelance work, client reviews, and technical articles.  
This site began as a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript build, evolved into a React + TypeScript app, and is now rebuilt with Next.js 15 for modern performance, SEO, and scalability.

Itâ€™s not just a showcase â€” itâ€™s my testing ground for design systems, motion-based UI, and full-stack experiments.

- **Client reviews** â€“ feedback pulled directly from my Upwork profile  
- **Technical articles** â€“ based on both client experience and deep research/practice projects  
- **Motion-rich design** â€“ nearly every component is animated, from headings and sections to lists, code blocks, and blog cards  

### Why Next.js?
